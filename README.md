# XGBoost_Titanic
Create and hyperoptimize easily, thanks to the scikit-learn pipeline,
a machine learning classifier model with xgboost,
for the titanic dataset from kaggle. Although this is a na√Øve model (without advanced feature engineering/selection) it performs really well: 86% accuracy after hyperopt.
